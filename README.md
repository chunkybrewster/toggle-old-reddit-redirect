# Toggle Old Reddit Redirect

Do you prefer the old style of interface for Reddit more than the new one?

Use Toggle Old Reddit Redirect to automatically redirect all Reddit URLs to the 'old.' prefix.

You can toggle the redirect on and off by clicking the toolbar icon. When it is turned back on it will automatically redirect all open tabs currently on Reddit to the 'old.' URL.

Toggle Old Reddit Redirect is compatible with Firefox, Chrome & Opera:

[Firefox Add On](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/toggle-old-reddit-redirect/)

The add on is currently under review by Chrome & Opera. I will add links to install the add on if it is successfully accepted.

This is my first browser add on that I've built. If you experience any issues or would like to suggest any improvements I could make, please add them to 'Issues' in the Github repository:
